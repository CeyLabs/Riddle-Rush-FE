# Telegram Authentication Setup

Simple guide to set up Telegram login for RiddleRush.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create Telegram Bot
1. Open Telegram, search `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose bot name: "RiddleRush Bot"
4. Choose username: "riddlerush_bot" (must end with "bot")
5. Copy the **username** (not the token)

### 2. Set Domain (for production)
1. Send `/setdomain` to BotFather
2. Select your bot
3. Enter: `https://yourdomain.com`

### 3. Configure Environment
```bash
# Edit .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_BOT_NAME=riddlerush_bot
```

### 4. Test
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Should redirect to login page with Telegram button
```

## âœ… That's it!

Your app now has Telegram authentication.

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues

**"YOUR_BOT_NAME" shows on login page**
```bash
# Fix: Set environment variable
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_BOT_NAME=your_bot_username" >> .env.local
```

**Telegram button doesn't work**
- Make sure you used `/setdomain` with BotFather
- For local dev, it should still work without domain

**Stuck on login page after clicking Telegram**
- Clear browser cookies and localStorage
- Check browser console for errors

## ðŸš¨ Need Help?

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify bot username is correct

- Avatar shows in navbar with logout option

**That's all you need to know!** ðŸŽ‰
